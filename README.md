# site_monitor.py

Changes accepted:

-Raw input by David; accepted because I had only one website in the url=, but now I can enter any website I want without having to look through any code
"raw input, so that you can change monitored website without going into the code
p.s. I hope this works"

-End loop option by Sam Wagner; accepted because the user could want to end the program
"I gave the user the option to end the loop. However, I used my patchy python skills, so it might not work."
